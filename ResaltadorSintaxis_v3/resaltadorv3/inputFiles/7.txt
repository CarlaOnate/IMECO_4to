; Use fn to create new functions. A function always returns
; its last statement.
(fn [] "Hello World") ; => fn
; (You need extra parens to call it)
((fn [] "Hello World")) ; => "Hello World"
; You can create a var using def
(def x 1)
x ; => 1
; Assign a function to a var
(def hello-world (fn [] "Hello World"))
(hello-world) ; => "Hello World"
; You can shorten this process by using defn
(defn hello-world [] "Hello World")
; The [] is the list of arguments for the function.
