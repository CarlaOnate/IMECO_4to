; Clojure uses Java's object types for booleans, strings and numbers.
; If you want to create a literal list of data, use ' to stop it from
; being evaluated
'(+ 1 2) ; => (+ 1 2)
; (shorthand for (quote (+ 1 2)))
; You can eval a quoted list
(eval '(+ 1 2)) ; => 3

; Lists are linked-list data structures, while Vectors are array-backed.
